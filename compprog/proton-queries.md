# Proton's Queries

## Background

Someone asked me to compile some of the questions I asked in the NOI.PH server and list what I learned from these questions.

I have listed some of these questions. If I have an answer for it, there should be a link to a page that discusses the answer.

## Questions

1. How do you compute the `n`th term of an order-`k` linear recurrence faster than $$O(k^3 \log n)$$?
2. What is the periodicity of $$GL(n, \mathbb{Z} / p \mathbb{Z})$$?
3. How can you compute min-plus convolution in subquadratic time?
